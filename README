yet another .dotfiles repo

- zsh 
    .zshrc -> .dotfiles/_zsh/.zshrc
    contains oh-my-zsh as submodule (automatic update disabled)
- vim
    ~/.vimrc -> .dotfiles/_vim/.vimrc
    ~/.vim   -> .dotfiles/_vim/.vim
    contains plugins as submodules in _vim/.vim/bundle folder

TODO
    - fix link path when executed from .dotfiles folder itself (ok when from parent folder)
        -> links miss the .dotfiles folder, and thus refer to a broken target
