this repository contains my vim settings

on windows, assuming that repo have been cloned to ~/.vim folder, 
you have to create a ~/_vimrc as follows :

set runtimepath^=~/.vim/.vim
source ~/.vim/.vimrc

on linux, assuming that repo have been cloned to .vim-git (thus avoids conflictswith any .vim folder)

1) use symbolic links
~/.vimrc -> ~/.vim-git/.vimrc
~/.vim -> ~/.vim-git/.vim

2) use a ~/.vimrc that makes indirection as on windows

set runtimepath^=~/.vim-git/.vim
source ~/.vim-git/.vimrc
