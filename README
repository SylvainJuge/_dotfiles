=> BASH settings

    [windows 7 & further] : create symbolic links
        - open a command window as administator
        - execute command (mklink : using .\ in path is mandatory to make link relative)

        cd %userprofile%
        mklink .bashrc .\.dotfiles\_bashrc
        mkdir .\bin

TODO
    - add xmlstarlet for windows
    - make use of zsh aliases to use file associations
    - make configuration fit multiple environments using simple conditions
        - one for vidal
        - one for each personnal setup
        -> use a common file local to each computer
    - fix link path when executed from .dotfiles folder itself (ok when from parent folder)
        -> links miss the .dotfiles folder, and thus refer to a broken target
