O : move to the opposite corner on the same line of current visual selection (v_O)

visual markers : < -> start of visual selection
                 > -> end of visual selection
thus, to move to start|end of selection we can use `< and `>

Ctrl-w : delete word before cursor 
Ctrl-r{reg} : insert content of register {reg}, as if typed
Ctrl-r Ctrl-r{reg} : insert content of register {reg} literally
