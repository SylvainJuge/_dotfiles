This file contains all things i've learned and those that I still need to

=== TODOs ===

TODO : custom keyboard mappings
    create a map that shows all possiblitiles (should be a nice graph/visu project)

TODO : find/create a plugin that enable to have per-project configurations
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/456792/vim-apply-settings-on-files-in-directory

TODO : disable search on F1, but put ":help " in command buffer to search for a subject

TODO : remap Ctrl+V Ctrl+C Ctrl+X Ctrl+Z to their original mapping (see mswin.vim )

TODO : search how to use buffers batch operations (bufdo)

TODO : display marks in buffers 
    -> sounds like it is not possible (according to help)

TODO : find how to manipulate xml tags
    -> nothing more than cit, cat, dit, dat, ... => find a plugin for xml

TODO search highlight
    'hl' variable defines all search highlight types
    :[no]hlsearch disables current highlight

TOOD status line 
    - how to trigger update when needed ( without user moving cursor )

TODO text formatting
    right center and left commands 
    look at fmt command line tool

TODO truncate long lines
    wrapmargin

TODO open search in rigt window instead of top half window
    this mapping does open a new in a separate tab : "noremap <F1> :tabnew<CR>:help<CR><C-W>o"
    issue: must reuse current help window if already available 

TODO multiple configurations
        - using a local file that .vimrc uses to detect which parameters should be used

TODO fullscreen display

=== Keyboard Mappings ===

add <silent> : avoids command to be printed in command line after its execution
add <unique> : avoids to override an already defined mapping
add <expr> : string is an expression and have to be evaluated (ex: function calls)
Note: not all features are available within function, but returning characters allow to execute stuff after return
